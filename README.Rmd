Varstan is a a package for bayesian estimation of structured time series models,using the Hamiltonian monte carlo method, implemented with [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/), a probabilistic language model in C++. The aim of varstan is to have an interface of the most popular time series modeles such as: sarima,garch, stochastic Volatility models (*SVM*), Hiden Markov models(*HMM*), Dynamic Harmonic regresion, additive non-linear models (*via* [prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)), univariate kalman Filters, varma and bekk models.

On the beta version 0.5.0.000, the avaliable models are:
 
  + arima
  + Seasonal arima
  + garch
  + varma
  + Bekk
  + Dynamic regression
  +Dynamic Harmonic regresion

The dynamic of varstan is to build your own model using one of the avaliable model constructor, personalize your own priors (*check the Use Priors vignette*), and fit your model using the varstan function. On the next example we show you how to create and fit a simple bayesian arima model.

### Installing varstan

Varstan is stil a beta version package, so currently installing it could be challenging, we recomend to first install the package rstan, you can follow the instalation procedure [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

### Troubleshooting Rstan / Rtools install for Windows:

Ensure recent version of R and Rtools is installed.

try including these lines in home/.R/makevars. :

    CXX14 = g++ -std=c++1y
    CXX14FLAGS = -O3 -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-function

If makevars does not exist, run this code within R:

``` {r,eval = FALSE}
dotR <- file.path(Sys.getenv("HOME"), ".R")
if (!file.exists(dotR)) dir.create(dotR)
M <- file.path(dotR, ifelse(.Platform$OS.type == "windows", "Makevars.win", "Makevars"))
if (!file.exists(M)) file.create(M)
cat("\nCXX14FLAGS=-O3 -march=native -mtune=native",
    if( grepl("^darwin", R.version$os)) "CXX14FLAGS += -arch x86_64 -ftemplate-depth-256" else
      if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") "CXX11FLAGS=-O3 -march=native -mtune=native" else
        "CXX14FLAGS += -fPIC","CXX11FLAGS=-O3 -mtune=native CXX14 = $(BINPREF)g++ -m$(WIN) -std=c++1y",
    "CXX14 = g++ -std=c++1y","CXX14FLAGS = -O3 -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-function",
    file = M, sep = "\n", append = TRUE)
```


### Install varstan from git


For installing varstan package for git use the code on the next chunk:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("rstan","bridgesampling","loo","Rcpp","rstantools","devtools"))
library(devtools)
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("C:/Rtools/bin", Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep=";"))
Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("C:\\Rtools\\mingw_64\\bin", Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep=";"))
Sys.setenv(BINPREF = "C:/Rtools/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/")
install_github("asael697/varstan",dependencies = TRUE)
```
 
 
### Current models 
 
The package offers an S3 object for the basic models implemented, for simplicity you can use the \code{version} function to see the list of all the models implemented in the actual package version:

```{r}
version(View = FALSE)
```

### Case suty: Analyzing the monthly live birth in U.S. an example

As an example, we provide a time series modeling for the monthly live births in the United States 1948-1979, published by *Stoffer2019*. In *figure 1* , the data has a seasonal behavior that repeats every year. The series *waves* in the whole 40 years period (*superior part*). In addition, the partial (*pacf*) and auto-correlation (*acf*) functions  are far from zero (*middle part*), and have the same wave pastern as birth series. Indicating non stationary and a strong cyclical behavior. After applying a difference to the data, the acf and pacf plots still have some non-zero values every 12 lags (*inferior part*).

```{r fig1,fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig1}Monthly live birth U.S.A"}
dbirth = diff(birth)

g1 = autoplot(birth)+labs(y= "births (thousands)",title ="U.S. Monthly live births")
g2 = ggAcf(birth)+labs(y ="births",title = "ACF")
g3 = ggPacf(birth)+labs(y ="births",title = "PACF")
g4 = ggAcf(dbirth)+labs(y ="differenced births",title = "ACF")
g5 = ggPacf(dbirth)+labs(y ="differenced births",title = "PACF")


grid.arrange(g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,layout_matrix = lay1)
rm(g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,dbirth)
```

For start, a seasonal ARIMA model could give a good fit to the data, following *Tsay2010* recommendations for order selection using the auto-correlation functions,  we define p = 1, d = 1, q = 1 and for the seasonal part P=1, D = 1 and Q = 1. The model is defined in *varstan* as follows

```{r}
model1 = Sarima(birth,order = c(1,1,1),seasonal = c(1,1,1))
model1
```

The function *Sarima()* generates a Seasonal ARIMA model ready to be fitted in *Stan*. As the model is printed, all the important information is shown: the model to be fit, the total observations of the data, the seasonal period, the current observations that can be used after differences, and a list of priors for all the model parameters. Using the information provided by the *acf plot* in figure 1 (*middle right*), the partial auto-correlations are not that strong, and a normal distribution for the auto-regressive coefficient (*ar[1]*) could explore values close to 1 or -1, causing the prior to be too informative. Instead beta distribution in $[-1,1]$ (*If $\theta \sim beta(\alpha,\beta)$ in $[0,1]$ then $\theta_1 = 2(\theta-1) \sim beta(\alpha,\beta)$ in $[-1,1]$*)  centered at zero, could be a more proper prior. With the functions *set_prior()* and *get_prior()* we automatically update and check our changes.

```{r}
model1 = set_prior(dat = model1,type = "ar",par1 = 2,par2 = 2,dist = "beta")
get_prior(dat = model1,type = "ar")
```

Now that the model and priors are defined, what follows is to fit the model using the *varstan()* function. We simulate 1 chain, of 2,000 iterations and warm-up of the first 1,000 chain's values. 

```{r,results='hide', message=FALSE}
sfit1 = varstan(model1,chains = 1)
```


All fitted models are *varstan* objects, these  are S3 classes with the *stanfit* results provided by the *rstan* package, and other useful elements that make the modeling process easier. After fitting our model we can make a visual diagnostic of our parameters, check residuals and fitted values using the plot method. On *figure 2* trace and posterior density plots are illustrated for all the model parameters.

```{r fig2}
plot(sfit1,type = "parameter")
```

to have multi-modal distributions, indicating that all chains have mixed and converged. One useful way to assess models fit, is by the residuals ($e_t = Y_t - \widehat{Y}_t$). The package provides the posterior sample of every residual, but checking all of them is an exhausting task. An alternative, is checking the process generated by the residuals posterior estimate. A white noise behavior indicates a good model fit. The model's residuals in figure 3, seems to follow a random noise, the auto-correlation in *acf plots* quickly falls to zero, indicating an acceptable model fit.

```{r fig3}
p1 = plot(sfit1,type = "residuals")
p2 = plot(sfit1)

grid.arrange(p2,p1,ncol = 1)
```

Because of the sinusoidal pattern that birth series (*figure 1*) presents, a dynamic Harmonic regression (*A fourier transform with arima structure for errors*) could also assess a good fit  *harima*. To declare this model, varstan offers a similar declaration structure of *Rob2007* **forecast** package. A harmonic regression with 4 fourier terms and ARIMA(1,1,1) residuals is declared and fitted to the birth data.

```{r,results='hide'}
model2 = Sarima(birth,order = c(1,1,1),xreg = fourier(birth,K = 2))
sfit2 = varstan(model = model2,chains = 1,iter = 2000,warmup = 1000)
```


```{r}
sfit2
```

In this scenario both models seem to be a good choice for birth series analysis. Even so the harmonic regression fits more parameters. It is an obvious choice for birth's sinusoidal behavior. As an example of model selection criteria, we compute the *bayes_factor()* in logarithmic scale, that compares the marginals models likelihoods, values above 6 (*in logarithmic scale*) provide good evidence for selecting the first model. And for birth data, the seasonal arima model (*model1*) is a better choice. 


```{r}
bayes_factor(x1 = sfit1,x2 = sfit2,log = TRUE)
```

Now, a comparison of our selected model (*model1* $\sim$ *Sarima(1,1,1)(1,1,1)[12]*) and the one given by the *auto.sarima()* function, for it we are gonna use a leave of one out cross validation *loo()*, and compare both looic with the *loo_compare()* function provided by the loo package.

```{r, results='hide'}
sfit3 = auto.sarima(birth,chains = 1,iter = 4000)
```

```{r}
sfit3
```

Different from model1, the selected one does not contemplate an auto-regressive component, and use 2 mean average components instead. Now let's proceed to estimate the loo for both models:

```{r}
loo1 = loo(sfit1)
loo3 = loo(sfit3)

lc = loo::loo_compare(loo1,loo3)
print(lc,simplify = FALSE)
```


*loo_compare()* prints first the best model. In this example is the one provided by the *auto.sarima()* function, where its *looic* is 2 unit below model1. This function is useful as starting point. But we encourage the reader to test more complex models and priors that adjust to the initial beliefs.
